## Overview

The goal of this course is to prepare students for the Basic Qualification Exam. There will be two lectures a week. Lectures will focus on both the theory and problem solving techniques for problems that frequently show up on the analysis and linear algebra portion of the basic. There will be a heavier emphasis on the analysis poriton of the exam. 

Starting in week 2, students will be given a **weekly** **quiz** during the first 10 minutes of the course on Mondays. 

Students will also be broken into groups of 3 biweekly and assigned **weekly** **group** **homework** related to the lecture material.  

There will also be **one** **four** **hour** proctored **exam** during the quarter during week 5. This is done to replicate the qualification exam test setting. 

Students will also be given **two** old basic qualification exams during week 3 and 7. Students will spend four hours attempting the exam. Afterwards, another peer will grade their exam. This portion will be graded for completion.

In addition, starting in week 2 every student will meet Thierry two times throughout the quarter in a **one on one meeting for 30 minutes each time**. In this meeting, students will be asked to either solve previous homework problems.
